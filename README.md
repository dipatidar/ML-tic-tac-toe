# ML-tic-tac-toe
# TicTacToe game prediction using multiple DataSets and ML models
This repository contains a project that implements several models to play tic-tac-toe with an ML algorithms mainly KNN, linear regression and MLP.

As a project coursework, set of classification and a set of regression algorithms were implemented. 

A comparative study of the performance has been attached in the project report.
